\section{Introduction}
The main topics of this project are the revolutionary RISC-V architecture, multi-core and the boot. The first approach that is given is to 
fit a multi-core RISC-V processor into a \gls{fpga} and boot a Linux operating system. However, the objective was not as straightforward as it was planned. The study and the work done is presented in this document. Firstly, RISC-V architecture and \gls{fpga} are introduced. Then, a core selection is done among the best option for our \gls{fpga} board. Finally, it is explained the modifications done to the core and how it has been verified.
