\section{\gls{fpga}}

A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a integrated circuit designed to be configured after the  manufacturing. FPGAs can be used to test amd debug implementations of hardware circuits and can be configured as  hardware accelerators. In this project, we have use a Xilinx FPGA to simulate and test the design of a multicore RISC-V. This section is dedicated to intoduce the main characteristics of an FPGA, its architecture and an overview of the resources available on the FPGA board that we have used. 

\subsection{FPGA Architecture}
An FPGA has a regular structure of logic cell or modules that are interconnected in a matrix form. The main components are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Configurable Logic Block (CLB):} it is the basic logic resource. It can implement logic functions throught a Look-up Table and contains flip-flops and multiplexers. 
	\item \textbf{I/O Blocks:} the Input/Output blocks ar used to access the peripherals. 
	\item \textbf{Switch Matrix:} network of switches that is used interconnect CLBs and I/O blocks in a flexible way.
\end{itemize}

As it is hown in the image below, the components are distributed in a regular  form. The Bitstream is loaded to provide logical functions and interconnections of different blocks.

\subsection{Xilinx Spartan 7 SP701}
Xilinx Spartan 7 SP701 is the model of the board where we will run a RISC-V core. It is built for designs requiring sensor fusion such as industrial networking, embedded vision, and automotive applications. This product is uncommon material since the specializded target of users and the high cost. At this point, it is important to distinguish beetween the board and the FPGA chip. The XC7S100  is the Spartan Serie 7 chip which is assembled in the board. The resource availble are: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{FPGA chip:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{102400 Logic elements (LE)}: smallest units of logic (8 bit Look-up Table). LEs  provide advanced features with efficient logic like LUT
	   	\item \textbf{16000 Adaptive Logic Module (ALM)}: more complex boolean using up to 16 bit Look-up Tables functions with/without registers
	    	\item 400 I/O operations per second %Input output operations per second 
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Board  Resources:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Memory:} DDR3L 4Gb (256M x 16)
		\item \textbf{5 pushbuttons}
		\item \textbf{16 DIP switches}
		\item \textbf{8 LEDs}
		\item \textbf{HDMI Video Output}
		\item \textbf{2 RJ-45}
		
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
